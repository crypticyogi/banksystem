# banksystem
The Sparks Foundation internship task
I was assigned a task to create a simple banking system. 
In this project I had to create a database of 10 dummy data of users in a bank.
Then I had to create a logic in order to transfer amount between two users.
There should also be a page showing all the transactions.
